## Usage

1. Clone the project to one of the SoC servers' home directory. The home directory is shared across the cluster.
2. Make sure dependencies are installed `pip3 install -r req.txt`
3. Fill in your private key path in `mi_nus_soc_gpu_status_reader.py` if you are using key pair to authenticate, if not use this line instead(uncomment)
```
client.connect(f'{host}.comp.nus.edu.sg', username='mingda', password='PASSWORD_HERE')
```

Now run `mi_nus_soc_gpu_status_reader.py`
