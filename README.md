# NUS SoC cluster GPU status checker

## Sample output

![Sample Output](https://github.com/Meowzz95/mi_nus_cluster_gpu_status/blob/master/images/sample_output.png)

## Usage

1. Upload `mi_gpu_slave_script.py` to your home directory. Upload to one server is enough as the home directory is shared.
2. Make sure dependencies are installed `pip3 install -r req.txt`
3. Fill in your private key path in `mi_nus_soc_gpu_status_reader.py` if you are using key pair to authenticate, if not use this line instead(uncomment)
```
client.connect(f'{host}.comp.nus.edu.sg', username='mingda', password='PASSWORD_HERE')
```

Now run `mi_nus_soc_gpu_status_reader.py`
:)


## TODO

- Multi-thread?
- CLI args?
